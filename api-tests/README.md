## Prerequisites
- Postman v11.34.5 (used for creating and running Postman collections)
- Node.js >= v16
- Newman >= v6 (used for running Postman collections in CLI)

## Setup
- Import the Postman collection `Atum-Service_DEV_env.postman_environment.json` into Postman. 
  - This file will set up env variables.
- Import the Postman collections for `1-shot` test:
  - `1_shot/Atum-Service_1-Shot_test_isolated_calls.postman_collection.json`
    - Contains all tests for REST API endpoints where one request call is enough for `1-shot` coverage.
    - Each test calls one REST API endpoint **in isolation**.

## Backup
- Export the Postman collections and replace the current ones in the project repository. (Rename to avoid spaces in the file name)
  - Why: To have a backup of the current state of the collections.
- Each collection is exported separately.

## Collection Types
Note: Each Postman collection run in sequence from the top to the bottom.

- **Isolated one**:
  - Contains only one request call per endpoint.
  - Cover only simple cases of simple endpoints - CRUD ones are covered in **flow** type.
- **Flow**:
  - Contains multiple request calls in form of a flow.
  - Cover complex cases of endpoints - CRUD ones are covered here.
  - The flow collection consist from multiple folders, each folder represents one named test with required preparations.
    - Folders allows to:
      - keep documentation test headers
      - split multiple tests related to one flow

## Terms
- `1-shot` category: Each REST API endpoint should be covered here only one call (ideally).
  - Why: To reach the goal of the minimalist test with coverage of all published application endpoints.
  - Goal: All requests have to pass without any error. Test should be defined with this goal.

## Run Tests

### Local Using Postman
- Open Postman.
- Import the Postman env file.
- Import the Postman collection.
- Select the environment for the collection.
- Run the collection.

### Local Using Newman
```yaml
cd api-tests

newman run ./1_shot/Atum-Service_1-Shot_test_isolated_calls.postman_collection.json \
--environment Atum-Service_DEV_env.postman_environment.json --reporters cli,csv --insecure \
--reporter-csv-export 1_shot_test_run_1.csv
```
