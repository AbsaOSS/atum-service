# The project supports Scala 2.12 and the default version of spark2
# The CI runs all tests suites for all supported Scala versions at build.yml
# The codebase for all Scala versions is the same, so the coverage is calculated only once
# Scala 2.12 is chosen since it is supported by the most wide range of Spark versions and
# vendor distributions.
