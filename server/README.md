# Atum Web Service

## How to build and run (will be updated soon)

To create a jar file that can be executed:

```shell
> sbt clean "project server" assembly
> java -jar server/target/jvm-2.13/*.jar
```

If you want to quickly build and run from sbt you can run using the command below (alternatively you can execute za.co.absa.atum.server.Main within your IDE). This deploys it to `localhost:8080`.

```shell
sbt "server/runMain za.co.absa.atum.server.Main"
```

### REST API Reference 

The REST API exposes a Swagger Documentation UI which documents all the HTTP endpoints exposed.
It can be found at **{REST_API_HOST}/docs/** (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/docs/`)
